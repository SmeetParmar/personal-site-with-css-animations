                So, let me start from first. I was also an average student during my childhood as well as in school life. I can still remember during my school time, I hardly do any homework and start studying a day before of exam. I know that is not good at all but unfortunately I was one of that type of student who don't like to study at all. On the other hand I love to play outside whole day. Cricket and Dodge ball were one of my favourite outdoor sports at that time. But as an when I completed my 10th standard I realised importance of studies and punctuality in life. From that time I became serious about my life and I started making goals. After completing my 12th I decided to do Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Atmiya University, Rajkot, Gujarat, India.

                During my college life I worked on many different computer languages like C, C++, C#.NET, ASP.NET, PHP, MySQL,  CodeIgnitor, JAVA, Android, Laravel and many more. Out of that I worked hard on front end that includes HTML, CSS and JS and on backend language i.e. PHP. I created many projects using that (which are listed in projects page). Then I decided to take Web Development course at Conestoga College, Kitchener, Ontario, Canada to study in more detph about Web Development. And currently I am studying here and this site is also one of my project. In future I will do a job related to my field and will gain good experience and will sharpen my skills.

            <h2 class="aboutHead">My Background</h2>
            <p class="ordered-list hide">
                So, let me start from my childhood. During my chilhood I was very calm boy who loves to play outside but I didn't like studying at all. At that time after coming from school from 1PM afternoon till at night 8PM I used to play with my friend. I still remember my mother used to scold me and take me to home for dinner and my homework. I know it is not good at all but I was one of them. But somehow I completed my school life and entered into high school i.e. 10th standard. From that time my life changes. Now, I started understanding importance pf hard work, honesty, punctuality, marks, studies and many more in our life. So, finally I started implementing that all. Then I started focusing in classes and stated studying hard and preparing for exams, and finally I scored good marks in 10th and 12th standard.

                Then one of the toughest time came of every student's life. That was to choose which course to take for future and go in which field. I was confused with many things that includes money, friends, stress, suceess, failure, hardness, etc. Then finally after consulting many relatives and friends I decided to pursue Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from my hometown. During my college time, I did many projects and learned a lot. Not only this, I also chilled put with friends and watched movies but at the end we enjoyed college life.

            <h2 class="aboutHead">My Hobbies</h2>
            <p class="ordered-list hide">
                In my childhood days, I have a good hand on drawings. I loved that subject in my school other than any subject. I was not concentrating in other subjects but on drawings lecture, I pay total attention and work with full dedication. At that time I was knowing different styles of drawing that includes sketch, colouring, outlining, different arts, shadow effects, real effects, 3D effects, and so on. At that I also had interest in art and craft things. You know making best from waste like thing. Talking about other hobbies, in sports I loved swimming the most. I used to go to learn swimming in government coaching in my home town and I used to swim daily for 3 hours. This reduced my body fat and made me fit. Then I also had hobby of playing badminton in my teenage life. I used to play badminton every night with my friends and relatives. And lastly, I also have hobby of cleaning my home almost each day, if not possible then definitely once per 3 days. Because cleaning your home maked it better and bacteria free. This will ultimately help you to stay healthy and you will love your place.
