            <p class="ordered-list">
                Everyone is familier with youTube right, so am I. Since teenager I used to watch you tube a lot and to be more specific, on youTube I used to watch game videos, comedy vides and Taarak Mehta Ka Oolta Chasma serial. After sometime I started watching gaming montages. So, since then I started taking interest in making those type of videos. Since then passion of video editing build within me. After sometime, I started searching how to edit video and to use which software. After many research, finally I got one good and easy free video editior. That was Wondershare Filmora. It is very good tool for making effects and trasititons in video editing. So, I learned that made 2 montages. 1st montage was on mobile game Marvel's Championship and other was on PC Game Valorent. 2nd one was a beat sync montage too!

                <br><br>

                While working on them I learned many new different things in the field of video editing that includes transitions, animations, keyframing, trimming audio, adjusting beats and adding effects from outside, working with speed of video and many more things. After that I had make a lyrical video. Then lastly, I also made one video vlog in which I was on a trip with my college friends. We were out for 7 days had we have recorded every moment of trip. But then difficult task was to edit that all cilps, adding transitions and description with good auido. I have done that and posted video on you tube. It was a great journey for me so far. Still whenever I am free, I love to d video editing. I have pasted some videos below for your reference, do check them out.

                    When we talk about web develoment, 1st thing comes to our mind is HTML, CSS and JS. Because it is basic for front-end development i.e. for making interface of a website. I started learning it from my college. Then when I mastered it, then I started making projects using these. I made almost 10 to 11 projects just using HMTL, CSS and JS to give beautiful effects as well as funtionity using Advance JS. Everyone thinks that it is very easy, but it is not everyone's cup of tea. But somehow I am managing to find error in google and solving it.

                    Then after some time I came across one platform called Bootstrap. It is a very very useful tool for web designers because it is exactly like CSS, but its extended and simplified version wherein we can use CSS just by calling the specified class. For example, if you want to make a font larger and bolder, you will need to make seperate CSS and define everything there. But using bootstrap you just need to call "fs-1" class and it will do all things. That's the magic of bootstrap. In most of my project I used bootstrap.

                    During my college time I have done 2 Internships at 2 different firms. So, let me share details about that. Firtst was at Excellence ICT Solutions, Rajkot, Gujarat, India for 6 months and it was basically a The Journalism Site wherein there are 4 main entities, Publisher, Author, Reviewer and Editor. Here author can upload the paper and after approval of reviewer and editor publisher will publish this paper. Here we have provided many functionalities like the author can pay the fees, E-Mail services, Feedback system and many more. It is currently live now.
                    Here we have worked using PHP language for connecting to database and functionalities.

                    2nd Internship was at Imbusoft Software, Rajkot, Gujarat, India for 3 months. It was a Alumni Portal where every past student's information. Each student can login with their student number. It had many facilities where every student can take guidance from seniors and alumnies can give any freelance work or project to intern students. Faculties can also take part in.
                    Here we have worked using a PHP platform called Laravel.

                    In majority of my projects I have used MySQL for database. Let me tell you about MySQL , it is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for managing and manipulating data in various applications and websites. MySQL continues to be a popular choice for database management due to its performance, scalability, and extensive community support. It is widely used in both small and large-scale applications across various industries.
        
                    <br><br>

                    MySQL is a bit difficult because sometime it throws unexpected errors which we don't know how to handle and we can end up in a problem. Same case was with us, if we fix one error other would rise up, if we fix that 3rd error would rise up. If somehow we solve it then again 1st error pops out. That's very annoying and boring. But with help of modern tools like google and youtube we managed them all and successfully completed projects.
